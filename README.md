Stock Market Analysis

From The Stock Data and the Test Dat the following was tested:

1. To create a script that will loop through the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information:

  - The Ticker Symbol.
  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the           closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
 
2. The Yearly Change column was then conditionally formatted so that positive change appeared in green and negative change appeared in red.
